Each section of the webpage contains notes of the following items: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. These items can be explored to refresh a student in these areas of study. If the Chrome DevTools console is opened, it will show the JavaScript that is running on the webpage. This will give a suggestion on what to study first in the study guide.
